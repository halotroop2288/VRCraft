# VRCraft
You know how [Vivecraft](http://www.vivecraft.org) is a jar
mod you have to install?
This is (going to be) that, but as a normal mod you can drop in
and load with Fabric.

## Goals
 - [x] Server plugin equivalent
   - So you can run Fabric mods on the server and play Vivecraft
   with friends.
   - **Done, but requires further debugging and testing.
   Message on Discord if you want to help out.**
 - [ ] Non-VR client mod
   - So you can use a modded Fabric client to play with VR-using friends
   - Currently in-development.
 - [ ] VR client mod
   - A full replacement for Vivecraft, fully ported to Fabric
   with no other mods required, but many supported!
